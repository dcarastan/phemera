# 'phemera

A forgetful blog. Posts are markdown. They don't have titles, tags. It has no
features, because when you can't see things that were written a few days ago why
would you need them?

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hawx/phemera
$ cd phemera
$ mv settings.toml.dist settings.toml
$ go build
$ ./phemera
```
